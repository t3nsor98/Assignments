The bug life cycle involves several stages, which are crucial for managing and resolving software defects effectively. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved in the bug life cycle:

1. **New**: A bug is discovered by a tester during the testing process. The tester logs the bug and provides a detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it.

2. **Assigned**: The bug is assigned to a developer for resolution. The developer reviews the bug report and decides whether it's valid or not.

3. **Open**: The developer starts working on the bug and analyzes the issue to determine the best course of action.

4. **Fixed**: The developer makes the necessary code changes and verifies that the bug is resolved.

5. **Test**: The bug is passed to the testing team for verification. The tester re-tests the bug to ensure it's fixed.

6. **Verified**: The tester confirms that the bug is indeed fixed and the software functions as expected.

7. **Closed**: The bug is marked as closed, indicating that it's been resolved and won't reoccur.

8. **Reopen**: If the bug reappears after being closed, it's reopened and the process starts again from the "Assigned" stage.

Here's a diagram illustrating the bug life cycle:

```
          +---------------+
          |  New  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Assigned
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Open  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Fixed
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Test  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Verified
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Closed  |
          +---------------+
                  |
                  |  Reopen
                  v
          +---------------+
          |  Assigned  |
          +---------------+
```

This diagram shows how a bug moves through the different stages of the bug life cycle, from discovery to resolution and potential reopening.

### Q2. Discuss any four bug tracking tool.

Ans:
Here's a discussion of four bug tracking tools:

### 1. Jira

Jira is a popular bug tracking tool that offers a comprehensive set of features for managing and tracking software defects.
