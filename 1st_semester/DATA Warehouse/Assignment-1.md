### Q1 "A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile gathering of data in support of management’s decision-making process” justify the statement by giving the example of each property of data warehouse.

Ans:
The statement "A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile gathering of data in support of management’s decision-making process" accurately describes the fundamental characteristics of a data warehouse. Here's a breakdown of each property with examples:

1. **Subject-Oriented**: A data warehouse is designed to focus on a specific theme or subject, providing insights and information relevant to that area. For instance, a data warehouse for a retail company might be subject-oriented towards sales, inventory management, or customer behavior.

Example: A data warehouse for a retail company might contain data on sales by product category, customer demographics, and geographic location to help managers make informed decisions about inventory management and marketing strategies.

2. **Integrated**: Data warehouses integrate data from various sources into a unified, organized, and consistent format. This ensures that data is accessible and usable across different departments and teams.

Example: A data warehouse for a financial institution might integrate data from different departments such as accounting, investments, and customer service to provide a comprehensive view of the organization's financial performance and customer behavior.

3. **Time-Variant**: Time-variant data warehouses store data over time, allowing for historical analysis and trend identification. This is particularly useful for tracking changes in business operations, customer behavior, or market trends.

Example: A data warehouse for a manufacturing company might store data on production levels, inventory levels, and sales by quarter, enabling managers to analyze trends and make informed decisions about production planning and inventory management.

4. **Non-Volatile**: Data warehouses are designed to be non-volatile, meaning that once data is stored, it is not updated or modified. This ensures that historical data remains intact and can be used for analysis and reporting.

Example: A data warehouse for a healthcare organization might store patient records, medical procedures, and treatment outcomes over time. This data would be non-volatile, allowing healthcare professionals to analyze trends and make informed decisions about patient care without altering the historical data.

In summary, a data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant, and non-volatile gathering of data that supports management's decision-making process by providing insights and information relevant to specific business areas and historical trends.


### **Q2. With example explain the concept of Multi-dimensional data model. Explain the various operations of multi-dimensional data model by giving the example of each model**

The concept of Multi-dimensional data model is a method used for ordering data in a database along with good arrangement and assembling of the contents in the database. It allows customers to interrogate analytical questions associated with market or business trends, unlike relational databases which allow customers to access data in the form of queries. The Multi-dimensional Data Model is used to show multiple dimensions of the data to users. It represents data in the form of data cubes. Data cubes allow to model and view the data from many dimensions and perspectives. It is defined by dimensions and facts and is represented by a fact table. Facts are numerical measures and fact tables contain measures of the related dimensional tables or names of the facts.

The Multi-dimensional Data Model works on the basis of pre-decided steps. The following stages should be followed by every project for building a Multi Dimensional Data Model:

1. **Assembling data from the client**: In this stage, a Multi Dimensional Data Model collects correct data from the client. Mostly, software professionals provide simplicity to the client about the range of data which can be gained with the selected technology and collect the complete data in detail.

2. **Grouping different segments of the system**: In this stage, the Multi Dimensional Data Model recognizes and classifies all the data to the respective section they belong to and also builds it problem-free to apply step by step.

3. **Noticing the different proportions**: In this stage, it is the basis on which the design of the system is based. In this stage, the main factors are recognized according to the user’s point of view. These factors are also known as “Dimensions”.

4. **Preparing the actual-time factors and their respective qualities**: In this stage, the factors which are recognized in the previous step are used further for identifying the related qualities. These qualities are also known as “attributes” in the database.

5. **Finding the actuality of factors which are listed previously and their qualities**: In this stage, A Multi Dimensional Data Model separates and differentiates the actuality from the factors which are collected by it. These actually play a significant role in the arrangement of a Multi Dimensional Data Model.

6. **Building the Schema to place the data, with respect to the information collected from the steps above**: In this stage, on the basis of the data which was collected previously, a Schema is built.

For example, let us consider a firm. The revenue cost of a firm can be recognized on the basis of different factors such as geographical location of firm’s workplace, products of the firm, advertisements done, time utilized to flourish a product, etc.

The Multi-dimensional Data Model is used in various operations such as:

1. **Roll-up**: This operation and aggregate certain similar data attributes having the same dimension together. For example, if the data cube displays the daily income of a customer, we can use a roll-up operation to find the monthly income of his salary.

2. **Drill-down**: This operation is the reverse of the roll-up operation. It allows us to take particular information and then subdivide it further for coarser granularity analysis. For example- if India is an attribute of a country column and we wish to see villages in India, then the drill-down operation splits India into states, districts, towns, cities, villages and then displays the required information.

3. **Slicing**: This operation filters the unnecessary portions. Suppose in a particular dimension, the user doesn’t need everything for analysis, rather a particular attribute. For example, country=”jamaica”, this will display only about jamaica and only display other countries present on the country list.

4. **Dicing**: This operation does a multidimensional cutting, that not only cuts only one dimension but also can go to another dimension and cut a certain range of it. As a result, it looks more like a subcube out of the whole cube(as depicted in the figure). For example- the user wants to see the annual salary of Jharkhand state employees.

5. **Pivot**: This operation is very important from a viewing point of view. It basically transforms the data cube in terms of view. It doesn’t change the data present in the data cube. For example, if the user is comparing year versus branch, using the pivot operation, the user can change the viewpoint and now compare branch versus item type.

These operations are used to manipulate data to meet the needs of users. They help to select particular data for the analysis purpose.
