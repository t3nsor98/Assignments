**Q1. What are the various categories into which network is classified.**

Computer networks are classified into several categories based on their geographical span, size, and purpose. These categories include:

1. **Personal Area Network (PAN)**: A PAN is the smallest network, typically limited to a single person or a small group of devices within a single room. It covers a range of up to 10 meters and includes devices such as Bluetooth-enabled devices, infra-red enabled devices, and wireless computer keyboards and mice.

2. **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A LAN is a network that spans a limited geographical area, usually within a building or a campus. It is designed to connect multiple devices within a single administrative domain and can cover a range of up to 2 kilometers. LANs are commonly used in homes, offices, schools, and libraries.

3. **Campus Area Network (CAN)**: A CAN is a network that covers a larger geographical area than a LAN but smaller than a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN). It is typically used in places like schools, colleges, and universities to connect multiple buildings within a campus.

4. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A MAN is a network that covers a metropolitan area, such as a city or a town. It is designed to connect multiple LANs and CANs within a metropolitan area and can cover a range of up to 10 kilometers.

5. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A WAN is a network that covers a wide geographical area, such as a country or a continent. It is designed to connect multiple MANs and LANs across a wide area and can cover a range of up to thousands of kilometers.

6. **Body Area Network (BAN)**: A BAN is a network of wearable computing devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and heart-rate monitors.

7. **Storage Area Network (SAN)**: A SAN is a network that connects multiple storage devices, such as hard drives and servers, to provide a centralized storage solution.

8. **Home Area Network (HAN)**: A HAN is a network that connects multiple devices within a home, such as computers, printers, and televisions.

9. **Enterprise Private Network (EPN)**: An EPN is a network that connects multiple devices within an enterprise, such as a company or an organization.

10. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: A VPN is a network that extends a private network across the internet and lets users access a private network remotely.

11. **Passive Optical Local Area Network (POLAN)**: A POLAN is a type of computer network that uses optical splitters to split an optical signal from a single strand of single-mode optical fiber to multiple signals.

12. **Passive Optical Wide Area Network (POWAN)**: A POWAN is a type of computer network that uses optical splitters to split an optical signal from a single strand of single-mode optical fiber to multiple signals across a wide area.

These categories are not mutually exclusive, and some networks may overlap between categories.


Q2. Compare and contrast the working of different networking devices and also mention the criteriaâ€™s which should be taken into consideration while designing a network.

To compare and contrast the working of different networking devices and mention the criteria to consider while designing a network, we can analyze the functionalities and considerations related to switches, routers, and access points.

### Switches:
- **Working**: Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. They use MAC addresses to forward data within a LAN. Switches create a direct connection between devices, enabling efficient data transfer.
- **Criteria for Design**: When designing a network, consider the number of ports needed, the speed of the switch (measured in Mbps or Gbps), and whether managed or unmanaged switches are required. Managed switches offer more control and security features.

### Routers:
- **Working**: Routers operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model. They use IP addresses to route data between different networks. Routers determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.
- **Criteria for Design**: Consider the routing protocols supported, such as OSPF or BGP, the number of WAN ports needed, and the throughput capacity of the router. Security features like firewall capabilities are also important.

### Access Points:
- **Working**: Access points operate at the physical layer (Layer 1) and data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. They provide wireless connectivity to devices within a network. Access points create a wireless network for devices to connect to.
- **Criteria for Design**: When designing a network, consider the coverage area of the access point, the supported wireless standards (e.g., 802.11ac), and the number of devices it can support simultaneously. Security features like WPA2 encryption should also be considered.

### Criteria for Designing a Network:
1. **Network Requirements**: Understand the purpose of the network, the number of users, the amount of data being transferred, and the services required (voice, messaging, etc.).
2. **Network Size**: Consider the area of coverage, the location of users, and the hardware needed to support the network.
3. **Data Transfer Rate**: Ensure that the network can handle the estimated traffic with the expected response times and cover the required physical reach.
4. **Connectivity**: Determine whether wired, wireless, or a combination of both is needed. Consider the type of cabling, computers, and equipment to be used.
5. **Compatibility**: Ensure that all network devices are compatible with each other to avoid connectivity issues.
6. **Security and Redundancy**: Consider features like firewalls, data encryption, user authentication, and redundant networks to enhance network security and reliability.
7. **Bandwidth and Speed**: Check the bandwidth capacity of the network to ensure smooth data flow without congestion.
8. **Scalability**: Design the network to be scalable, allowing for expansion as needed without compromising performance.

By comparing the functionalities of switches, routers, and access points and considering the criteria mentioned above, a well-designed network can meet the requirements of users, provide efficient data transfer, and ensure network security and reliability.
