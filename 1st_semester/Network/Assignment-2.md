Q1. What do you understand by IP addresses? Difference between IPV4 and IPV6.

IP addresses are unique numerical identifiers assigned to devices connected to a network to facilitate communication and identification. They play a crucial role in routing data packets across networks. IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of the Internet Protocol that define how IP addresses are structured and used.

### Understanding IP Addresses:
- **IP Address**: An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as an identifier for devices to communicate with each other on a network.
- **IPv4**: Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is a 32-bit address system that uses decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It provides around 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **IPv6**: Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a 128-bit hexadecimal address system that uses a larger address space and a more efficient header structure compared to IPv4. IPv6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

### Differences between IPv4 and IPv6:
1. **Address Length**: IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, while IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long.
2. **Address Format**: IPv4 addresses are in decimal format separated by periods, while IPv6 addresses are in hexadecimal format separated by colons.
3. **Address Space**: IPv4 provides around 4.3 billion unique addresses, which are becoming scarce. IPv6 offers a significantly larger address space, capable of providing trillions of unique addresses.
4. **Header Structure**: IPv6 has a simpler and more efficient header structure compared to IPv4, which enhances speed and efficiency.
5. **Connection Integrity**: IPv6 supports end-to-end connection integrity, which is not achievable in IPv4.
6. **Support for QoS**: IPv6 provides stronger support for Quality of Service (QoS) features, improving traffic prioritization and enhancing audio and video quality.
7. **Mobile Device Support**: IPv6 offers better support for mobile devices, enabling quick and secure connections compared to IPv4.
8. **Classes**: IPv4 addresses are divided into classes (A, B, C, D, E), while IPv6 does not have address classes.
9. **VLSM Support**: IPv4 supports Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM), while IPv6 does not support VLSM.

In summary, IP addresses are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network. IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of the Internet Protocol, with IPv6 offering a larger address space, simpler header structure, and better support for modern networking requirements compared to IPv4.
